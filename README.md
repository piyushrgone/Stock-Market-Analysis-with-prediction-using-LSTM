# Stock-Market-Analysis-with-prediction-using-LSTM
The "Stock Market Analysis with Prediction Using LSTM" project is a GitHub repository that offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing and predicting stock market trends using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. The historical stock price data is borrowed from Yahoo Finance. Yahoo Finance is a widely recognized and trusted platform that provides comprehensive financial information, including historical stock prices, for a vast range of publicly traded companies.

The repository includes several key components and features to facilitate the analysis and prediction process. These components are:

Data Collection: The project incorporates methods to retrieve historical stock price data from reliable sources such as financial APIs or web scraping techniques. It ensures that the data is up-to-date, accurate, and covers a significant timeframe to enable meaningful analysis.

Data Preprocessing: To prepare the stock market data for analysis, the project implements various data preprocessing techniques. These techniques include handling missing values, normalization, feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

LSTM Model Implementation: The core of this project lies in the implementation of the LSTM algorithm. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that has proven effective in capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data. The repository provides a well-structured LSTM model implementation that incorporates features like multiple LSTM layers, dropout regularization, and stateful training.

Model Training and Evaluation: The project offers functionality to train the LSTM model on the preprocessed data. It utilizes techniques such as backpropagation through time (BPTT) and mini-batch training to optimize the model's performance. The model's accuracy and performance metrics are evaluated using various evaluation methods, including mean squared error (MSE) and accuracy scores.

Visualization and Analysis: The repository provides tools and functions to visualize the historical stock price data, predicted values, and evaluation metrics. These visualizations help users gain a better understanding of the underlying patterns and trends in the stock market.

Prediction and Forecasting: With the trained LSTM model, the project enables users to generate future stock price predictions and forecasts. These predictions can aid investors and traders in making data-driven decisions regarding buying, selling, or holding stocks.

Documentation and Examples: The project includes comprehensive documentation that guides users on how to use the code effectively. It provides step-by-step instructions, code explanations, and usage examples to facilitate understanding and utilization.
